# LaserTank
LaserTank is a mini-game that consists of player, enemy, and mirrors. The player can control the movement by using the W, A, S, D keys and shoot the laser by using the F key. The laser will be reflected when it hits the mirrors. After the game ends, all the game history will be saved into a log file by using a linked list.
